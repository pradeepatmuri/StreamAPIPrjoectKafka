1. Refer to the code added under kafka.day4.t2.streamingapi.StreamingTest

2. Now start zookeeper normally after clearing the temp directory then kafka server with normal properties

3. Open a producer console producer using following command
   kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic src-topic

4. Open a consumer console using following command
   kafka-console-consumer.bat --topic out-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
   
5. Now run the java program then pass the message in producer console
